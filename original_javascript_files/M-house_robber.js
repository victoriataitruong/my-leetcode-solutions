Leetcode 198: House Robber

Problem Description:
You are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but there are two important rules:
1. You cannot rob two adjacent houses because they will alert the police.
2. You need to maximize the amount of money you can rob.

Given an array of non-negative integers representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police. The solution must be solved in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of houses.

Approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming (Optimized)**: Use two variables to track the maximum money we can rob up to the current house, without storing the entire dynamic programming table.
2. **Iterate Through the Houses**: For each house, calculate the maximum money we can rob if we either rob it or skip it.
3. **Return Maximum Money**: At the end of the loop, return the maximum money that can be robbed.

var rob = function(nums) {
    // If there are no houses, return 0 (nothing to rob)
    if (!nums.length) return 0;

    // If there is only one house, return the amount in that house
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

    // Initialize two variables to track the maximum money we can rob
    // 'prev1' keeps track of the maximum money we can rob up to the previous house
    // 'prev2' keeps track of the maximum money we can rob up to two houses ago
    let prev2 = 0;
    let prev1 = 0;

    // Loop through each house in the list
    for (let num of nums) {
        // For the current house, decide whether to rob it or skip it
        // If we rob the current house, we add its money to the max amount we could have robbed two houses ago
        // If we skip the current house, we carry forward the max amount from the previous house
        let curr = Math.max(prev1, prev2 + num);

        // Update prev2 and prev1 for the next iteration
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }

    // After the loop, prev1 will contain the maximum money that can be robbed
    return prev1;
