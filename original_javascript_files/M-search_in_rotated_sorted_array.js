Leetcode 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Problem Description:
Given a rotated sorted array `nums` and an integer `target`, write a function to search for the `target` in the array. If the `target` exists, return its index, otherwise return `-1`. The array is initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at some unknown pivot, which means the array might not be sorted at the start. You must implement an algorithm with **O(log n)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

Approach:
1. **Binary Search**: Since the array is rotated, we can still use binary search, but with a slight modification to account for the rotation.
2. **Check Sorted Half**: We need to determine whether the left or right half of the array is sorted. Once we know that, we can narrow down which half of the array to search.
3. **Adjust Search Range**: Depending on whether the target is in the sorted half or the unsorted half, adjust the search range accordingly.
4. **Return Index**: If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return `-1`.

class Solution {
    search(nums, target) {
        // Initialize the left and right pointers for binary search
        let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        // Perform binary search
        while (left <= right) {
            // Find the middle index
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

            // If the target is found, return the index
            if (nums[mid] === target) {
                return mid;
            }

            // Check if the left half is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                // If target is in the sorted left half
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            // If the right half is sorted
            else {
                // If target is in the sorted right half
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // If target is not found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
