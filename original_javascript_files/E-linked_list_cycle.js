Leetcode 141: Linked List Cycle

Problem Description:
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. A cycle means that the linked list's last node points to one of the previous nodes, creating a loop. If there is no cycle, return false. If there is a cycle, return true. The solution should be solved in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Approach:
1. **Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**: Use two pointers, one moving slowly (tortoise) and one moving fast (hare).
2. **Slow and Fast Pointer Movement**: Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps. If the linked list has a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
3. **Return True or False**: If the slow pointer meets the fast pointer, return true (cycle exists). If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (null), return false (no cycle).
